GoogleMapWidgetV3
=================
An easy to use widget to embed Google Map API lvl 3 in Vaadin 6 applications, since Google has discontinued its service on Map API lvl2.

Based on former "GoogleMapWidget" (seems it's no more in this directory)

Copy:
  WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/vaadin-googlemapwidgetv3.jar
  WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/gwt-ajaxloader-1.1.0.jar
  WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/gwt-maps-api-3.10.0-alpha-6.jar
to your ROOT/WEB-INF/lib and compile widgetset
